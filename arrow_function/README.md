An arrow function is a concise way to write function expressions.
Arrow functions were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provide a more concise syntax compared to traditional function expressions.

Arrow functions do not have their own this, arguments, super, or new.target. They inherit these values from the enclosing scope.
